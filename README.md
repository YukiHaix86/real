# REAL

This is my personal project. 
Creating a good looking (at least to some standards..) website and trying to learn more SCSS and JS on the way. 

After slacking off for a bit I noticed the struggle so I created this project.

I am using Vite, SASS and JS for this project. 

It is still in its early stages so maybe more will come
